The SES index was computed based on the well-established method reported by the Agency of Healthcare Research and Quality [20]. Specifically, a principal analysis on a set of seven measures was conducted across the entire set of 211,267 U.S. census block groups. These seven measures include unemployment rate among persons aged 16 years or older (pct_unemp), percentage of persons below the US poverty line (pct_poverty), median household income (hhinc100), median value of owner-occupied homes (prop100), percentage of persons with less than a 12th-grade education (low_educ), percentage of persons aged > 25 years with at least 4 years of college (high_educ), and percentage of households containing one or more person per room (crowded). Then, principal components were determined. As the first principal component accounts for most of the variance common to the seven measures, the loading scores of these seven measures on the first principal component was determined and used to estimate the SES index. The formula was used to compute the SES index in this study as below:  
SES Index Score = 50 + (-0.07*crowded)+(0.08*prop100)+(-0.10*pct_poverty)+ (0.11*hhinc100)+(0.10*high_educ)+(-0.11*low_educ)+(-0.08*pct_unemp)
